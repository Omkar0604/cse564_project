Global Terrorism Visualization Dashboard

The data visualization on the Global Terrorism project provides a comprehensive understanding of the patterns and trends of terrorism over time, geographic regions, and types of attacks. It includes several types of visualizations such as a world map with color coding to represent the number or severity of incidents, a parallel coordinate plot to show how different factors are related to each other, a donut chart to show types of attacks, a word cloud to highlight areas of vulnerability, and a multiline plot to provide a comprehensive view of the impact of terrorism. These visualizations can inform policy and strategy development by helping to identify specific types of targets and allocating resources more effectively. The project demonstrates strong skills in data visualization and analysis, and a deep understanding of the nature of terrorism.
